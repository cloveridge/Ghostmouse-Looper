A simple utility with GUI for looping Ghostmouse recordings. Give it a number of loops, the number of seconds between each loop, and the
key to press at the start of each iteration (Ghostmouse can be set to activate upon the press of a specific key, such as  F6).

Ghostmouse is not required, but it's free and runs with no istallation. Basically, any keylogger which can loop at the press of a key
will work. There is a link to the ghostmouse site on the form.
